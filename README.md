# CPPND: Program a Concurrent Traffic Simulation

<img src="data/traffic_simulation.gif"/>

This project simulates traffic using concurrent programming. The simulation consists of four traffic objects: Streets, Intersections, Traffic ligts, Vehicles. Each of these objects are implemented using classes which extends the base TrafficObject class. The simulation of each instance of these traffic objects is run inside a separate thread. The program uses mutexes, condition variables, and other synchronization techniques to pass information in-between the threads.
